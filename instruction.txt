1. call() function should be available in user's code from where recursive function would get called.

2. Function name of recursive function can be anything, return type can be anything, state value  can be anything, number of state can be anything.

3. if(cntOfpathOfRecursion == pathLimit)throw new Exception();int pastCnt = firstLine(); should be added before all recusrsion call in recursion body.

4. lastLine(pastCnt); should be added after all recusrsion call in recursion body.

5. Any recursive call should be made between lines described in point 3 and 4.

6. If user want to print or show anything in state, he/she has to write it in state() function. state can take upto 7 paremetres. But last paremeter should always take pastCnt arguement;

7. Only one recursive function can be simulated, otherwise user can write his own recursion but lines described in point 3 and 4 should only be added to that recursive function which is going to be simulated.

8. Code should be in java.

9. code generating more than 1000 states is not accepted.

10. Otherwise, you can write anything, declare anything(maybe except variables I used or keywords) and call anything.

Thank You.
